## Getting Started

### Login

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Click **Sign In** (top-right corner)
3. Enter your organizational email (e.g., `john.smith@yourdomain.com`)
4. Enter your password
5. Approve multi-factor authentication (MFA) if prompted
6. You're logged in! ✅

### Your First Look

Once logged in, you'll see:

- **Connection Status** (top left) - "Connected (M365)" or "Offline"
- **Tabs** (below status) - Census, Surgical, Calendar, Staffing, Archive
- **Action Buttons** (top right) - Add Patient, Import, Export, Settings
- **Patient Table** - All active patients with status indicators

### Patient Status Colors

| Status | Color | Meaning | Icon |
|--------|-------|---------|------|
| **To-Do** | Gray | Not started | ⬜ |
| **In-Progress** | Blue | Currently being managed | 🔵 |
| **Completed** | Green | Finished | ✅ |
| **Post-Op** | Amber | Post-operative period | ⭐ |
| **STAT** | Bright Red | Urgent/Priority (entire card goes red) | 🔴 |

**STAT Priority Visual**: When you toggle STAT priority ON in the patient form, the entire "Stat Acuity" card becomes bright red with a thick dark border and red glow effect. This makes urgent cases impossible to miss.

---

#### Understanding Visit Keys & Same-Patient Records

**What is a Visit Key?**

The app uses a "Visit Key" system where each patient visit is uniquely identified by:
- **Patient MRN** + **Visit Date**

**This means:**
- Same patient, **different date** = **New separate record**
- Same patient, **same date** = **Update the existing record** (no duplicate)

**Real-World Examples:**

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Jan 16: See patient John (MRN 12345), findings "UTI suspected" | ✅ New record created for Jan 16 |
| Jan 18: See same patient, findings now "UTI confirmed" | ✅ New separate record created for Jan 18 |
| Jan 16 again: Update findings to "UTI ruled out" | ✅ Same record updated (no duplicate created) |

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ No accidental duplicates for same patient on same day
- ✅ Each visit date is tracked separately
- ✅ Findings stay up-to-date for each visit
- ✅ You can see history across multiple visits

**"Copy from Previous Visit" Feature:**

When adding the same patient on a new date, click: **"Copy from Previous Visit"**

This auto-fills:
- ✅ Room, Hospital, Name, DOB, MRN
- ✅ Treatment Plan, Supervising MD
- ❌ **Does NOT copy**: Findings, Pending tests, Follow-ups (fresh per visit)

**Pro Tip**: Use this when rounding on the same patient across different days!

### Editing a Patient Record

## Tabs & Views

The application has several tabs to manage different aspects of patient care and scheduling.

### The Census Tab

The Census tab shows all **active, ongoing patient records**.

#### What You'll See

- All patients admitted today or before
- Procedures and treatments in progress
- Sorting: Patients are sorted by STAT priority first, then by date

#### Typical Workflow

1. **Morning Rounds**: Review all patients, update findings
2. **During Rounds**: Quick status changes via dropdown
3. **Add New Patients**: Click + Add Patient as they arrive
4. **End of Day**: Review pending items, archive discharged patients

#### Keyboard Tips

- **Mobile**: Tap rows to edit, use dropdown for quick status
- **Desktop**: Click + drag to scroll through long lists

### The Surgical Tab

The Surgical tab shows only **procedures and surgical cases** (filtered by keywords: cysto, stent, TURBT, laser, surgery, etc.).

#### Use Cases

- **OR Board**: View what's scheduled vs. completed
- **Procedure Tracking**: Follow pre-op, operative, and post-op phases
- **Coordination**: See which procedures are planned vs. in progress

#### Status Workflow for Procedures

1. **To-Do** - Scheduled, not started
2. **In-Progress** - Actively in operating room
3. **Completed** - Finished, monitoring post-op
4. **Post-Op** - Recovery phase, monitoring for complications

#### Filtering

The surgical tab **auto-filters** based on keywords in findings or plan. If your patient doesn't appear, it means the keywords didn't match. You can still add it manually to the Census tab.

### The Calendar View

The Calendar tab displays a **monthly overview** of patient admissions and procedures.

#### Calendar Features

- **Red dots** = Procedures/surgeries scheduled
- **Federal holidays** = Marked with emoji (🎄 Christmas, 🦃 Thanksgiving, etc.)

## CSV Import & Excel Export

### Import Census from Excel

Use this to bulk-load patients from an Excel/CSV file.

#### Supported Format

Your CSV file should have:
- **Row 1-3**: On-call provider information (optional)
- **Row 4**: Column headers (Room, Date, Name, DOB, MRN, Findings, Plan, MD, Pending, Follow-Up)
- **Row 5+**: Patient data rows
- **Section headers**: Hospital names (e.g., "Abrazo West", "BEMC") with rest of row empty

#### How to Import

1. Prepare your CSV file following the format above
2. Click **📥 Import Files** button
3. Select one or more files (CSV, XLSX, or XLS)
4. **Preview Modal Opens** showing:
   - Total files selected
   - Count of NEW records (will be added)
   - Count of DUPLICATES (same MRN + date already exist)
   - Per-file breakdown
5. **Choose action**:
   - **✓ Import All** - Add new records + replace duplicates with file data
   - **✓ Import New Only** - Add new records, skip duplicates (preserve existing)
   - **✗ Cancel** - Don't import anything
6. The app will:
   - Parse on-call assignments from rows 1-3
   - Detect hospital sections automatically
   - Create patient records (based on your choice)
   - Show progress and success count

#### Bulk Import (Multiple Files)

You can import multiple workbooks at once:

1. Click **📥 Import Files**
2. Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) and select multiple files
   - Example: Select `2024.xlsx`, `2025.xlsx`, `2026.xlsx`
3. The app processes **all sheets** in **all files** automatically
4. Preview shows aggregated summary across all files
5. Choose import action (Import All or New Only)
6. All files imported in seconds

**Use Case - Historical Data**: Import 3 years of workbooks in one operation instead of one-by-one.

#### Duplicate Detection

The app prevents duplicate records using **compound key**: `MRN + Date`

**Examples**:
- File has: MRN 12345, Date 2025-01-16 → Already exists → **DUPLICATE** ⚠️
- File has: MRN 12345, Date 2025-01-17 → Not in system → **NEW** ✅
- File has: MRN 99999, Date 2025-01-16 → Not in system → **NEW** ✅

**When to use "Import All"**: File has corrected/updated data, you want to replace existing records

**When to use "Import New Only"**: Preserve existing data, only add new patients

#### Example CSV Structure

```
,Date of Service,PROVIDER ON CALL,ON CALL AT HOSPITALS
Physician On-Call:,2026-01-12,Jain,"WGMC, AWC"

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't log in"

**Problem**: You see "Unauthorized" or can't access the app.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're using your **organizational email** (e.g., firstname.lastname@yourhospital.org)
2. Check **Caps Lock** isn't on
3. Request your IT admin to verify your role assignment in Entra ID
4. Clear browser cache and try again
5. Try a different browser

### "Offline mode" appears unexpectedly

**Problem**: Status says "Offline" but you have internet.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your **internet connection**
2. Verify the **API is reachable**: Ask your IT admin if Azure Functions are running
3. Check browser **console** (F12) for error messages
4. Try **refreshing** the page
5. Restart your app and browser

### "Can't save patient"

**Problem**: You click Save but nothing happens or you see an error.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify **required fields** are filled:
   - Room (required)
   - Date (required)
2. Check for **duplicate**: If patient with same MRN + date exists, you'll get "Patient already rounded today"
   - Use **Copy from Previous Visit** to add a new date's visit
3. If billing codes show errors, you may not have **billing permissions** (expected for clinicians)
4. Check your **internet connection**

### "Can't export to OneDrive"

**Problem**: Export button doesn't work or fails.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're **signed in** with your organizational account
2. Check that you have **OneDrive access** (IT admin can verify)
3. Ensure the `/Clinical Rounding` folder exists in your OneDrive (or create it)
4. If permissions error, ask your IT admin to grant `Files.ReadWrite` permission
5. Try exporting again; if it fails, contact support

### "Data not syncing"

**Problem**: Changes made by another user aren't showing up.

**Solutions**:
1. Click the **refresh button** (status area) or wait 15 seconds
2. Close and reopen the patient record
3. Fully **refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
4. Check that both users are **online and connected**
5. If problem persists, verify the API backend is running

### "Copy from Previous Visit not working"

**Problem**: Button doesn't show or doesn't populate fields.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the **MRN field** is filled with the patient's ID
2. Ensure this patient has a **previous visit** in the system
3. If MRN is blank, the button is disabled (expected)
4. Check that you're trying to add a **new date** (different from previous visit date)

### "Can't see billing codes"

**Problem**: CPT/ICD fields are hidden or show `***`.

**Solutions**:
1. This is **normal for clinicians** - field masking is intentional for HIPAA
2. If you need billing access, ask your department administrator to assign you the **"billing" role**
3. Once role is changed, sign out and sign back in to see the fields

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: App is slow, fields lag when typing.

**Solutions**:
1. **Close other tabs/apps** to free up memory
2. **Clear browser cache** (Settings → Clear browsing data)
3. Try a **different browser** to isolate the issue
4. On mobile, **close other apps** and restart the device
5. Contact IT if the issue persists

### "Patient still shows after archiving"

**Problem**: Patient appears in both Census and Archive tabs.

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R)
2. Close and reopen the app
3. Wait 15 seconds for sync (polling interval)
4. Archive again if still visible
