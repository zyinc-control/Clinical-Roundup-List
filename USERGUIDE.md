## Getting Started

### Login

The app uses your organizational account for secure access.

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Click **Login** in the top action bar
3. Enter your organizational email (e.g., `john.smith@yourdomain.com`)
4. Enter your password
5. Approve multi-factor authentication (MFA) if prompted
6. You're in! ✅

**Note**: On first login, you may see "Local Mode" until credentials are configured. The app works in both modes: local storage for immediate use and cloud sync through M365/SharePoint when configured. After authentication, the same top-bar button changes from **Login** to **Logout**.

### Your First Look

Once logged in, you'll see:

- **Status indicator** - "Connected (M365)" or "Local Mode" or "Offline"
- **Quick stats** - Active patients, procedures, archived counts
- **Tab navigation** - Jump between Census, Surgical, Calendar, Staffing, Archive, Timeline, Analytics, Reports, Audit, Procedures, Shifts
- **Top action bar** - Login/Logout, Import Files, Add Record, Adv. Filters, Search, Settings, Help
- **Search + Adv. Filters** - Find patients instantly and narrow with presets, dates, statuses, and hospitals
- **Patient table** - All active patients with sorting and filtering

### Connection Modes

The app has three modes depending on your setup:

| Mode | Status | Features | Persistence |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Cloud (M365)** | 🟢 Connected (M365) | Real-time sync, multi-user, full features | SharePoint Lists (permanent) |
| **Local Mode** | 🟡 Local Mode | Full app features, fast, offline-ready | Browser storage (this session) |
| **Offline** | ⚫ Offline | View cached data, add locally, sync on reconnect | localStorage + IndexedDB |

**For admins**: If you see "Local Mode", your M365 credentials may not be configured yet. Contact your IT administrator.

### Visit Workflow Statuses

| Status | Color | Meaning | Icon |
|--------|-------|---------|------|
| **NEW CONSULT** | Slate | New consult visit | NC |
| **SURGICAL PATIENT (SAME DAY SURGERY)** | Blue | Active same-day surgical workflow | SDS |
| **NEW SURGICAL PATIENT (AM ADMIT)** | Cyan | New AM surgical admit | AM |
| **FOLLOW UP (CONSULT)** | Green | Non-post-op follow-up visit | FU |
| **FOLLOW UP (POST OP)** | Amber | Post-op follow-up | PO |
| **TO BE DISCHARGED/SIGNED OFF** | Rose | Ready to sign off or discharge | DC |
| **STAT** | Bright Red | Urgent/Priority (entire card goes red) | 🔴 |

**STAT Priority Visual**: When you toggle STAT priority ON in the patient form, the entire "Stat Acuity" card becomes bright red with a thick dark border and red glow effect. This makes urgent cases impossible to miss.

---

2. Fill in the form fields:
   - **Room** - Room number (required)
   - **Date** - Today's date (or select a different date)
   - **Hospital** - Select from dropdown
   - **Name, DOB, MRN** - Patient demographics
   - **Findings** - Clinical assessments
   - **Plan** - Treatment plan
   - **Supervising MD** - Attending physician
   - **Pending** - Lab work, imaging, procedures
   - **Follow-Up** - Follow-up appointments
   - **STAT Priority** - Toggle for urgent cases (shown as red block label in form)
   - **Procedure Status** - NEW CONSULT, SURGICAL PATIENT (SAME DAY SURGERY), NEW SURGICAL PATIENT (AM ADMIT), FOLLOW UP (CONSULT), FOLLOW UP (POST OP), or TO BE DISCHARGED/SIGNED OFF
   - **Billing Codes** - CPT/ICD codes (if you have billing permissions)

3. Click **Save** to add the patient
4. You'll see a success message: "✓ Saved"

#### Understanding Visit Keys & Same-Patient Records

**What is a Visit Key?**

The app uses a "Visit Key" system where each patient visit is uniquely identified by:
- **Patient MRN** + **Visit Date**

**This means:**
- Same patient, **different date** = **New separate record**
- Same patient, **same date** = **Update the existing record** (no duplicate)

**Real-World Examples:**

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Jan 16: See patient John (MRN 12345), findings "UTI suspected" | ✅ New record created for Jan 16 |
| Jan 18: See same patient, findings now "UTI confirmed" | ✅ New separate record created for Jan 18 |
| Jan 16 again: Update findings to "UTI ruled out" | ✅ Same record updated (no duplicate created) |

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ No accidental duplicates for same patient on same day
- ✅ Each visit date is tracked separately
- ✅ Findings stay up-to-date for each visit
- ✅ You can see history across multiple visits

**"Copy from Previous Visit" Feature:**

When adding the same patient on a new date, click: **"Copy from Previous Visit"**

This auto-fills:
- ✅ Room, Hospital, Name, DOB, MRN
- ✅ Treatment Plan, Supervising MD
- ❌ **Does NOT copy**: Findings, Pending tests, Follow-ups (fresh per visit)

**Pro Tip**: Use this when rounding on the same patient across different days!

### Editing a Patient Record

1. Click on a patient row in the table
2. The patient modal will open with all current data

## Import Files & Reports

### Import Census from Excel

Use this to bulk-load patients from an Excel/CSV file.

#### Supported Format

Your CSV file should have:
- **Row 1-3**: On-call provider information (optional)
- **Row 4**: Column headers (Room, Date, Name, DOB, MRN, Findings, Plan, MD, Pending, Follow-Up)
- **Row 5+**: Patient data rows
- **Section headers**: Hospital names (e.g., "Abrazo West", "BEMC") with rest of row empty

#### How to Import

1. Prepare your CSV file following the format above
2. Click **📥 Import Files** button
3. Select one or more files (CSV, XLSX, or XLS)
4. **Preview Modal Opens** showing:
   - Total files selected
   - Count of NEW records (will be added)
   - Count of DUPLICATES (same MRN + date already exist)
   - Per-file breakdown
5. **Choose action**:
   - **✓ Import All** - Add new records + replace duplicates with file data
   - **✓ Import New Only** - Add new records, skip duplicates (preserve existing)
   - **✗ Cancel** - Don't import anything
6. The app will:
   - Parse on-call assignments from rows 1-3
   - Detect hospital sections automatically
   - Create patient records (based on your choice)
   - Show progress and success count

#### Bulk Import (Multiple Files)

You can import multiple workbooks at once:

1. Click **📥 Import Files**
2. Hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) and select multiple files
   - Example: Select `2024.xlsx`, `2025.xlsx`, `2026.xlsx`
3. The app processes **all sheets** in **all files** automatically
4. Preview shows aggregated summary across all files
5. Choose import action (Import All or New Only)
6. All files imported in seconds

**Use Case - Historical Data**: Import 3 years of workbooks in one operation instead of one-by-one.

#### Duplicate Detection

The app prevents duplicate records using **compound key**: `MRN + Date`

**Examples**:
- File has: MRN 12345, Date 2025-01-16 → Already exists → **DUPLICATE** ⚠️
- File has: MRN 12345, Date 2025-01-17 → Not in system → **NEW** ✅
- File has: MRN 99999, Date 2025-01-16 → Not in system → **NEW** ✅

**When to use "Import All"**: File has corrected/updated data, you want to replace existing records

**When to use "Import New Only"**: Preserve existing data, only add new patients

#### Example CSV Structure

```
,Date of Service,PROVIDER ON CALL,ON CALL AT HOSPITALS
Physician On-Call:,2026-01-12,Jain,"WGMC, AWC"

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't log in"

**Problem**: You see "Unauthorized" or can't access the app.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're using your **organizational email** (e.g., firstname.lastname@yourhospital.org)
2. Check **Caps Lock** isn't on
3. Request your IT admin to verify your role assignment in Entra ID
4. Clear browser cache and try again
5. Try a different browser

### "Offline mode" appears unexpectedly

**Problem**: Status says "Offline" but you have internet.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your **internet connection**
2. Verify the **API is reachable**: Ask your IT admin if Azure Functions are running
3. Check browser **console** (F12) for error messages
4. Try **refreshing** the page
5. Restart your app and browser

### "Can't save patient"

**Problem**: You click Save but nothing happens or you see an error.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify **required fields** are filled:
   - Room (required)
   - Date (required)
2. Check for **duplicate**: If patient with same MRN + date exists, you'll get "Patient already rounded today"
   - Use **Copy from Previous Visit** to add a new date's visit
3. If billing codes show errors, you may not have **billing permissions** (expected for clinicians)
4. Check your **internet connection**

### "Can't generate a PDF report"

**Problem**: The Reports tab does not build a preview or the PDF download is unavailable.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure the selected date and hospital still return matching records
2. Change the report type and try **Generate PDF** again
3. Refresh the page and reopen the Reports tab
4. Check browser console errors if the preview area stays blank
5. If the issue persists, contact support with the report type and filters you used

### "Data not syncing"

**Problem**: Changes made by another user aren't showing up.

**Solutions**:
1. Click the **refresh button** (status area) or wait 15 seconds
2. Close and reopen the patient record
3. Fully **refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
4. Check that both users are **online and connected**
5. If problem persists, verify the API backend is running

### "Copy from Previous Visit not working"

**Problem**: Button doesn't show or doesn't populate fields.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the **MRN field** is filled with the patient's ID
2. Ensure this patient has a **previous visit** in the system
3. If MRN is blank, the button is disabled (expected)
4. Check that you're trying to add a **new date** (different from previous visit date)

### "Can't see billing codes"

**Problem**: CPT/ICD fields are hidden or show `***`.

**Solutions**:
1. This is **normal for clinicians** - field masking is intentional for HIPAA
2. If you need billing access, ask your department administrator to assign you the **"billing" role**

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use the app on my personal phone?**  
A: Yes, if it has a web browser and internet. Your organizational account login is required for security.

**Q: What happens if I close the browser while editing?**  
A: Unsaved changes are lost (this is expected web app behavior). Make sure to click Save before closing.

**Q: Can I edit archived patients?**  
A: Yes, open from Archive tab and make changes. Click Save to update.

**Q: How long is data kept?**  
A: According to your hospital's data retention policy. Ask your IT admin.

**Q: Can I access this app from outside the hospital network?**  
A: Yes, the app is cloud-based. Only your organizational login is required.

**Q: How do I print a patient record?**  
A: Select rows and use **Print Selected** in Selection Mode, or use the **Print** action from the Reports preview.

**Q: Is my data encrypted?**  
A: Yes, all data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest in SharePoint. Access is audited and logged.

**Q: What's the "Copy from Previous Visit" button?**  
A: It copies all data from the patient's last visit except findings, pending items, and follow-up (those are assumed to be new for each visit). Saves time entering repetitive info.

**Q: What's "Local Mode" vs "Connected (M365)"?**  
A: Local Mode = App works in your browser without cloud sync (fast, no setup). Connected = Data syncs to M365/SharePoint (shared team access). Contact IT admin to enable M365 mode.

**Q: How do I create a patient on multiple dates?**  
A: Same patient, different date = new visit record. Use "Copy from Previous Visit" to speed up data entry for repeat patients.

**Q: What does "Import New Only" vs "Import All" mean?**  
A: **Import New Only** = Add new records, skip duplicates (safe if unsure). **Import All** = Add new + replace duplicates with file data (use for corrections). See "Bulk Import (Multiple Files)" section for examples.
