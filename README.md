# Clinical Roundup List

A **modern healthcare patient census and rounding platform** for managing patient visits, procedures, and clinical notes. Runs as a mobile-first web app using modern JavaScript, now featuring full native Microsoft 365 (M365) integration with local “offline mode” by default.

## 🏥 Overview

**Clinical Roundup List** streamlines the rounding process for healthcare teams by providing:

- **Dual Operation Modes:**  
  - **Local Mode** (no configuration) for immediate use, stores data in browser, perfect for demos or small teams.
  - **M365 Mode** (optional) enables cloud sync and multi-user operation using SharePoint Lists and Microsoft Identity.
- **Real-time Patient Census** — Track patient status, room assignments, and clinical findings.
- **Bulk Import Preview** with duplicate detection and easy review.
- **Visual STAT Alerts:** Distinct, high-visibility STAT cards for urgent patients.
- All original features: Procedure management, on-call scheduling, CSV import/export, billing integration, role-based access, offline support, and audit logging.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend:** HTML + Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS (single HTML file, no build system)
- **Authentication:** MSAL.js (Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD)
- **Data Storage:**
  - **Local Mode:** localStorage (no setup needed)
  - **M365 Mode:** SharePoint Online (4 lists: Patients, OnCallSchedule, Settings, AuditLogs)
- **File Storage:** OneDrive for Excel exports
